A simple package for building command line applications in Go

## Questions

```
Q: Why another package?
A: The https://github.com/urfave/cli package that we love is not maintained.

Q: Why didn't fork it?
A: The package has a lot of legacy. So we decided to address that by completely
re-writing it and revamping the API.
```
